# The Rogue Ace

It’s like Uno but... 

Everyone draws 8 cards. If you start with two aces, keep one of them and throw the other one in the deck, draw a card and shuffle the deck until you have only one ace. The goal is to run out of cards. After drawing cards they pick a ruler and show that card face-up. The ruler has two abilities, suit abilities and card abilities, unless it is an ace or joker. Whenever I say “you cannot make a pair with this”, I mean you cannot use the ability to make a pair, three of a kind or four of a kind.  

### Suit Abilities:

- **Diamonds (Diamond Storm):** If you can play a diamond card, you can add another card to play with it. This does not count as a pair.  
- **Hearts (Campfire):** Every other card also count as the number on the heart card which is the ruler. Subsequent cards can also follow that number. You cannot make pairs with this ability.  
- **Spades (Sliced):** All spades you play can also count as the number that is half of it, rounding up. (face cards count as 10 and are sliced to 5). You can make pairs with this.  
- **Clubs (Strike):** You can play two cards at once if you have 5 or more cards and they both are playable cards. This counts as a pair.  

### Card Abilities:

- **2 (Twice the Might):** Two of a kind has double the effect.  
- **3 (Lucky Clover):** You can play a 7 whenever you want, and everyone else has to draw 2 cards.  
- **4 (Fourfold):** When you play a four of a kind, everyone puts all of their cards in the deck and shuffles them. Everyone else then draws 7 new cards while you draw 3.  
- **5 (High Five):** All face cards also count as fives. You CAN make a pair with this.  
- **6 (Nightmare):** Playing a six causes all other players to draw until they have 7 cards (or do nothing if they have more).  
- **7 (Lucky Spin):** You can play a 3 whenever you want, and everyone else has to draw 2 cards.  
- **8 (Seeing Red):** Whenever someone has 3 or less cards, anyone playing an eight makes that player draw 2 cards.  
- **9 (Reverse Nightmare):** Anyone playing a nine causes you to put cards back in the deck until you have 5 cards (or do nothing if you have less).  
- **10 (Perfection):** You can play an even numbered card (including queen) on top of another even numbered card. You cannot make a pair with this.  
- **J (Servant):** All cards above Jack including Ace can also count as the other cards in that section. (e.g. King also counts as Queen and Ace when playing). You can make a pair with this.  
- **Q (Ruler’s Touch):** Kings count as every other number and suit, and when played force everyone else to draw a card. You can make a pair with this.  
- **K (Ruler of Rulers):** Take the abilities of every other ruler’s card ability, but when you win you draw 5 cards and have to win again.  

### Ace Abilities:

- **Ace of Diamonds (The Perfect Card):** All odd numbered non-face card cards can be played at any time. Same rules as Perfection. You cannot make a pair with this.  
- **Ace of Hearts (Otherworldly Touch):** All hearts count as every other number and suit. All other suits can also count as this card, but do not get to count as every other number and suit. You cannot make a pair with this.  
- **Ace of Spades (Pocket Knife):** All cards also count as the card that is half their value, rounded down. (face cards count as 10 and are sliced to 5). You can make a pair with this.  
- **Ace of Clubs (Nuclear Bomb):** The first time someone wins, put all the cards back in the deck, shuffle it and give everyone except for that person 7 cards, and give that person 5 cards. If you win first, this does not take effect.  

### Gameplay:
After picking rulers, pick who is going first and drop the first card in the deck face up, just like Uno. To play a card, it must be either the same color (red or black), same number or a different number that is also even/odd (depending on the number).* After picking who goes first, also pick if you are going clockwise or counterclockwise. In a typical game, it rotates clockwise. Jack and King are odd, Queen is even.  

*there are some exceptions  

There are also some special combinations of cards that allow you to play multiple at once, with some special abilities. Here they are.  

### Combinations:

- **Pair:** Everyone else draws 2 cards.  
- **Three of a kind:** Everyone else draws 3 cards.  
- **Four of a kind:** Everyone else draws 4 cards.  
- **Straight:** You need at least 4 cards in a row to do this. Everyone else draws as many cards as the length of the straight minus 2.  
- **Flush:** You need at least a 4 card flush. Everyone else draws as many cards as the length of the flush minus 2.  
- **Even Only:** You need 5 even cards minimum. Everyone else draws as many cards as the amount of even cards you used minus 3.  
- **Odd Only:** Same rules as even only but odds only. Everyone else draws as many cards as the amount of odd cards you used minus 3.  

If you run out of cards and need to draw more, put the discard pile back into the deck and reshuffle. If a player cannot play any cards to match the card in the discard pile, they draw TWO cards.  

If you need to draw cards and there are no more cards in the deck OR discard pile, then have everyone place down cards one by one starting from the person who was first to play and draw those cards until you have enough.

### Game elements:
Play on floors like [pokerogue.net](http://pokerogue.net), but after you fight you can take their abilities (each enemy has a unique ability that makes them better) and then use them the next time you play. It’s called **“The Rogue Ace.”** No complaints.
