# The Rogue Ace

It’s like Uno but... 

Everyone draws 8 cards. If you start with two aces, keep one of them and throw the other one in the deck, draw a card and shuffle the deck until you have only one ace. The goal is to run out of cards. After drawing cards they pick a ruler and show that card face-up. The ruler has two abilities, suit abilities and card abilities, unless it is an ace or joker. Whenever I say “you cannot make a pair with this”, I mean you cannot use the ability to make a pair, three of a kind or four of a kind.  

### Suit Abilities:

- **Diamonds (Diamond Storm):** If you can play a diamond card, you can add another card to play with it. This does not count as a pair.  
- **Hearts (Campfire):** Every other card also count as the number on the heart card which is the ruler. Subsequent cards can also follow that number. You cannot make pairs with this ability.  
- **Spades (Sliced):** All spades you play can also count as the number that is half of it, rounding up. (face cards count as 10 and are sliced to 5). You can make pairs with this.  
- **Clubs (Strike):** You can play two cards at once if you have 5 or more cards and they both are playable cards. This counts as a pair.  

### Card Abilities:

- **2 (Twice the Might):** Two of a kind has double the effect.  
- **3 (Lucky Clover):** You can play a 7 whenever you want, and everyone else has to draw 2 cards.  
- **4 (Fourfold):** When you play a four of a kind, everyone puts all of their cards in the deck and shuffles them. Everyone else then draws 7 new cards while you draw 3.  
- **5 (High Five):** All face cards also count as fives. You CAN make a pair with this.  
- **6 (Nightmare):** Playing a six causes all other players to draw until they have 7 cards (or do nothing if they have more).  
- **7 (Lucky Spin):** You can play a 3 whenever you want, and everyone else has to draw 2 cards.  
- **8 (Seeing Red):** Whenever someone has 3 or less cards, anyone playing an eight makes that player draw 2 cards.  
- **9 (Reverse Nightmare):** Anyone playing a nine causes you to put cards back in the deck until you have 5 cards (or do nothing if you have less).  
- **10 (Perfection):** You can play an even numbered card (including queen) on top of another even numbered card. You cannot make a pair with this.  
- **J (Servant):** All cards above Jack including Ace can also count as the other cards in that section. (e.g. King also counts as Queen and Ace when playing). You can make a pair with this.  
- **Q (Ruler’s Touch):** Kings count as every other number and suit, and when played force everyone else to draw a card. You can make a pair with this.  
- **K (Ruler of Rulers):** Take the abilities of every other ruler’s card ability, but when you win you draw 5 cards and have to win again.  

### Ace Abilities:

- **Ace of Diamonds (The Perfect Card):** All odd numbered non-face card cards can be played at any time. Same rules as Perfection. You cannot make a pair with this.  
- **Ace of Hearts (Otherworldly Touch):** All hearts count as every other number and suit. All other suits can also count as this card, but do not get to count as every other number and suit. You cannot make a pair with this.  
- **Ace of Spades (Pocket Knife):** All cards also count as the card that is half their value, rounded down. (face cards count as 10 and are sliced to 5). You can make a pair with this.  
- **Ace of Clubs (Nuclear Bomb):** The first time someone wins, put all the cards back in the deck, shuffle it and give everyone except for that person 7 cards, and give that person 5 cards. If you win first, this does not take effect.  

### Gameplay:
After picking rulers, pick who is going first and drop the first card in the deck face up, just like Uno. To play a card, it must be either the same color (red or black), same number or a different number that is also even/odd (depending on the number).* After picking who goes first, also pick if you are going clockwise or counterclockwise. In a typical game, it rotates clockwise. Jack and King are odd, Queen is even.  

*there are some exceptions  

There are also some special combinations of cards that allow you to play multiple at once, with some special abilities. Here they are.  

### Combinations:

- **Pair:** Everyone else draws 2 cards.  
- **Three of a kind:** Everyone else draws 3 cards.  
- **Four of a kind:** Everyone else draws 4 cards.  
- **Straight:** You need at least 4 cards in a row to do this. Everyone else draws as many cards as the length of the straight minus 2.  
- **Flush:** You need at least a 4 card flush. Everyone else draws as many cards as the length of the flush minus 2.  
- **Even Only:** You need 5 even cards minimum. Everyone else draws as many cards as the amount of even cards you used minus 3.  
- **Odd Only:** Same rules as even only but odds only. Everyone else draws as many cards as the amount of odd cards you used minus 3.  

If you run out of cards and need to draw more, put the discard pile back into the deck and reshuffle. If a player cannot play any cards to match the card in the discard pile, they draw TWO cards.  

If you need to draw cards and there are no more cards in the deck OR discard pile, then have everyone place down cards one by one starting from the person who was first to play and draw those cards until you have enough. There are special things that happen when you play certain types of combos:

### Pairs:
- **A (Pocket Aces)**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play cards that are 10 or above.
- **2 (Pair Pair)**: Instead of drawing 2 cards everyone else has to draw 3 cards.
- **3 (Feeling Off)**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play odd numbers.
- **4 (Half the Cards): Until you play again, everyone else cannot play cards 8 and above.
- **5 (Medium Rare)**: Take one of your fives out of the discard pile after playing it, and then look through the discard pile and take one card from it. Then, put the rest of the cards into the deck and shuffle the deck. The five you took out of the pile will be the new discard pile.
- **6 (Devilish Stare)**: Pick one person. They don’t play for their next turn.
- **7 (Double Luck)**: Look at the next two cards in the deck. You can choose to replace one of your cards with one of those cards. Then, put the other cards on the top of the deck and shuffle the deck.
- **8 (Good Fortune)**: Put any one of your other cards onto the top of the discard pile. The next player will have to follow that card.
- **9 (Fort)**: Creates a “fort” in the discard pile. You can only destroy the fort by playing a pair. If you cannot destroy the fort, you have to draw a card. The fort automatically destroys itself when it becomes your turn unless you can play another pair. If the player that created the fort plays a pair or better on their next turn, the fort stays until destroyed or the next turn. The player that started the fort can keep up the fort as long as they have a pair or better. Other players that play a pair or better can also choose to keep the fort active instead of destroying it. You cannot play normal cards and you don’t draw two cards if you can’t play a card, only one if you don’t have a pair.
- **10 (Feeling Right)**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play even numbers.
- **J (High Card)**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play cards 8 and above.
- **Q (Complaint)**: Everyone else draws a card while you put one of yours back in the deck and shuffle it.
- **K (I am your Father)**: Until you play again, everyone else has to alternate between even and odd numbers. King and Jack count as odd numbers.

### Three of a Kinds:

- All Three of a Kinds start a fort. Same rules as the fort caused by playing a pair of nines, but instead to destroy it you must play a higher pair, but you can play a lower pair to avoid drawing cards (e.g. you play three of a kind tens so the fort created can only be destroyed by a pair of Jacks, Queens, Kings or Aces, but you can play a pair of 6s to avoid drawing two cards). Additionally, you have to draw 2 cards if you don’t have a pair. Three of a Kind Aces cause everyone else to draw five cards on top of the normal 3 cards (so 8 cards in total), and do not create a fort.

Four of a Kinds:
- **A. Pure Destruction**: Put 4 of your cards into the deck and shuffle it.
- **2. Two’s Domain**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play even numbers that are the suit of the number on top of the discard pile. If they do not have that kind of card, they have to draw 3 cards instead of 2.
- **3. Feeling More Off**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play odd numbers that are the suit of the number on top of the discard pile. If they do not have that kind of card, they have to draw 3 cards instead of 2.
- **4. Four Fours**: Everyone has to draw 5 cards instead of 4.
- **5. A Bit Above**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play numbers above 5 that are the suit of the number on top of the discard pile. If they do not have that kind of card, they have to draw 3 cards instead of 2.
- **6. Satanic Bomb**: Discard all of your cards except one.
- **7. Crazy Luck**: Look at all of the cards in the deck and trade any of your cards for any cards in the deck. After that put every card in the discard pile and the deck together, shuffle it and put the card on the top of the deck as the new discard pile.
- **8. Crazy Fortune**: Same effects as Crazy Luck.
- **9. Feeling Weird**: Until you play again, everyone else has to play perfect squares.
- **10. Ultimate Perfection**: Same effects as Feeling Weird.
- **J. Master Servant**: Until you play again, everyone has to play a queen or a king or else they have to draw 3 cards instead of 2.
- **Q. Second to One**: Until you play again, everyone has to play a king. If they don’t play a king, they don’t draw cards but you get to put one card back into the deck and shuffle the deck.
- **K. King of All**: Creates a fort that can only be destroyed by a three of a kind ace. This fort is not destroyed when it becomes the original player’s turn. Instead, as long as the fort is active the player who created it can put a card back into the deck and shuffle it, and then end their turn. Everyone else draws 1 card if they cannot destroy the fort.

The abilities that have just been mentioned are added on to the normal abilities of playing a pair, three of a kind or four of a kind. Everything mentioned after this replace the normal abilities of the straight or flush.

### Tiny Straight (lowest possible non-flush straight including ace)
Before your next turn, everyone else has to play either A, 2 or 3. If they don’t, they have to draw the length of the straight, Everyone else ALSO has to draw 2 cards anyways. Has to be at least 5 cards long.

### Royal Straight (highest possible non-flush straight)
Same rule as tiny straight, but everyone has to play a face card. Everyone else also has to draw 3 cards instead of 2 cards. Has to be at least 5 cards long.

### Tiny Flush or Royal Flush:
Everyone else draws 7 cards, but these flushes have to be 5 cards long or else they don’t count as tiny or royal flushes.

### Game elements:
Play on floors like [pokerogue.net](http://pokerogue.net), but after you fight you can take their abilities (each enemy has a unique ability that makes them better) and then use them the next time you play. It’s called **“The Rogue Ace.”** No complaints.
